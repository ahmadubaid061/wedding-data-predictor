# 💍 Wedding Date Predictor 2026

A fun, mystical, and interactive web application designed to predict wedding dates for friends and family using a "magic" algorithm. This project is optimized for high user engagement, data collection via Google Forms, and is "AdSense Ready" with strategic ad placement containers.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Mystical Prediction Engine
- **Interactive UI:** Features a floating, sparkling crystal ball animation created with pure CSS.
- **Personalized Results:** Users enter a friend's name to generate a specific wedding date and a unique "fortune" message.
- **Animated Results:** The prediction is displayed with a pulse-animation effect to enhance the "magical" feel.

### 2. Smart Data Collection (Google Forms Integration)
- **Silent Submission:** The app automatically logs every prediction (Friend's Name, Predicted Date, and Fortune) to a Google Sheet via a hidden iframe.
- **Lead Generation:** Includes a "Custom Website" offer that directs users to a contact form, allowing you to convert fun traffic into potential clients for custom web development.

### 3. "Clever" AdSense Integration
The repository uses a hybrid approach for Google AdSense to maximize revenue without ruining user experience:

- **Strategic Containers:** Pre-defined `ad-container` and `ad-space` divs are placed at the Top, Middle (after results), and Bottom of the page.
- **Auto-Ad Optimization:** These containers use `min-height` and transparent backgrounds. This acts as a "hint" to Google's Auto-Ads AI to place advertisements in these specific spots rather than over-lapping buttons or text.
- **Professional Look:** Until ads are approved, these spaces remain invisible to the user, keeping the site clean.

### 4. Essential Compliance Pages
- **About Page:** Describes the "mystical" nature of the tool and establishes the fun tone of the site.
- **Privacy Policy:** Includes the mandatory "Cookie" and "Data Usage" clauses required by Google AdSense for site approval.
- **Contact Form:** A fully functional contact page that maps directly to your Google Sheets for inquiry management.

## 🛠️ Setup & Customization

### Google Forms Setup
To make the forms work with your own Google Sheet:

1. Create a Google Form with fields for **Name**, **Prediction**, and **Date**.
2. Get the **"Pre-filled link"** to find the `entry.ID` numbers.
3. Replace the `action` URL and the `name="entry.xxxx"` attributes in the `index.html` and `contact.html` form sections.

### AdSense Setup
1. Once you receive your AdSense code, paste the `<script>` tag into the `<head>` of all HTML files.
2. Enable **Auto Ads** in your AdSense dashboard.
3. The AI will automatically utilize the `.ad-space` containers already styled in `style.css`.
