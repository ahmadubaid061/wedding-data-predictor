💍 Wedding Date Predictor 2026
A fun, mystical, and interactive web application designed to predict wedding dates for friends and family using a "magic" algorithm. This project is optimized for high user engagement, data collection via Google Forms, and is "AdSense Ready" with strategic ad placement containers.

🚀 Key Features
1. Mystical Prediction Engine
Interactive UI: Features a floating, sparkling crystal ball animation created with pure CSS.

Personalized Results: Users enter a friend's name to generate a specific wedding date and a unique "fortune" message.

Animated Results: The prediction is displayed with a pulse-animation effect to enhance the "magical" feel.

2. Smart Data Collection (Google Forms Integration)
Silent Submission: The app automatically logs every prediction (Friend's Name, Predicted Date, and Fortune) to a Google Sheet via a hidden iframe.

Lead Generation: Includes a "Custom Website" offer that directs users to a contact form, allowing you to convert fun traffic into potential clients for custom web development.

3. "Clever" AdSense Integration
The repository uses a hybrid approach for Google AdSense to maximize revenue without ruining user experience:

Strategic Containers: Pre-defined ad-container and ad-space divs are placed at the Top, Middle (after results), and Bottom of the page.

Auto-Ad Optimization: These containers use min-height and transparent backgrounds. This acts as a "hint" to Google's Auto-Ads AI to place advertisements in these specific spots rather than over-lapping buttons or text.

Professional Look: Until ads are approved, these spaces remain invisible to the user, keeping the site clean.

4. Essential Compliance Pages
About Page: Describes the "mystical" nature of the tool and establishes the fun tone of the site.

Privacy Policy: Includes the mandatory "Cookie" and "Data Usage" clauses required by Google AdSense for site approval.

Contact Form: A fully functional contact page that maps directly to your Google Sheets for inquiry management.

📁 Project Structure
index.html: The main "Predictor" application and landing page.

about.html: Information about the project and its entertainment purpose.

contact.html: Inquiry form for custom website requests.

privacy-policy.html: Legal disclosures for AdSense compliance.

style.css: Modern, mobile-responsive styles with purple/pink gradients.

🛠️ Setup & Customization
Google Forms Setup
To make the forms work with your own Google Sheet:

Create a Google Form with fields for Name, Prediction, and Date.

Get the "Pre-filled link" to find the entry.ID numbers.

Replace the action URL and the name="entry.xxxx" attributes in the index.html and contact.html form sections.

AdSense Setup
Once you receive your AdSense code, paste the <script> tag into the <head> of all HTML files.

Enable Auto Ads in your AdSense dashboard.

The AI will automatically utilize the .ad-space containers already styled in style.css.

📱 Responsive Design
The project is fully responsive and optimized for:

Desktop: Large crystal ball and side-by-side footer sections.

Mobile: Stacked inputs, simplified navigation menu, and touch-friendly buttons.
